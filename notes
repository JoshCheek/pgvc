Noms

  The versioned, forkable, syncable database
  Noms is a decentralized database philosophically descendant from the Git version control system.

Features
  needs to retain all versions
  should be able to rebuild the old version, even when there is a schema change later
  inserting a row in two different versions should be seen as the same thing, even if they get different ids
  instead of views, could do tables in schemas, and have a trigger on the table to go add the diff to the version control tables
